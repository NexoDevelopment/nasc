# Customization
You can easily customize (and run) this server.
You can also edit and play with the [account](https://www.github.com/NexoDevelopment/nasc/blob/master/nasc.py#L115) function

**This server will tell the 3DS that the NEX Server the console want to use is 123.222.444.555:60000**

**You can change this at the beggining of the script, the 3DS will try to connect to your UDP server at the corresponding address.**

**You can ALSO add checks (by yourself) for the Title ID so it sends different IP Address corresponding on the game**
